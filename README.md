# Graph-Zoo

The project aims to familiarize with two ways of representing oriented graphs,
one standard (through sets of nodes and arcs) and another constructive (algebraic), 
suitable for a functional approach. The solution is made using
application of functional, type (including polymorphism), lazy evaluation mechanisms in Haskell language and 
exploitation of lazy evaluation for the conceptual decoupling of performed processing.
